### Engine Driven Pump (EDP):

A variable-delivery, pressure-compensated EDP is the primary source of hydraulic power for each hydraulic system. The pump varies the amount of fluid delivered to maintain the required system nominal pressure of `20684.27 ± 1378.95 kPa (3000 ± 200 psi)`. The EDPs on the ERJ 170/175 have a rated output flow of `71.92 l/min (19 gal/min) at 4825 rpm`. The operating temperature range is `-54 to 85 °C (-65 to 185 °F)`. EDP 1A supplies hydraulic power to the No. 1 hydraulic system. EDP 2A supplies hydraulic power to the No. 2 hydraulic system. One EDP is mounted on the accessory gearbox of each engine and it is driven through a splined input shaft. Since the engine installations are identical, EDP 1A is mounted outboard of the left engine and EDP 2A is mounted inboard of the right engine. Each pump has a cylinder barrel containing nine pistons driven by the engine, via the splined input shaft. As the barrel rotates, the pistons reciprocate within their bores, intaking and discharging fluid through a stationary valve plate surface resting on the port cap. The compensator valve meters a volume of fluid to the stroking piston proportional to the change in pump output. This determines the amount of fluid expelled during each stroke of the pistons, thus providing the variable delivery required. Quick Disconnect Configuration: The suction, pressure, and case drain openings of the pump use quick disconnect couplings that connect to flexible hoses in the nacelle. The couplings reduce the amount of fluid drained when the lines are disconnected for EDP removal. A drain line from the front of the pump casing is connected to a nacelle drain gallery. This drain line dumps fluid overboard through the nacelle, during the discharge of normal shaft seal seepage. B-nut Configuration: The suction, pressure, and case drain openings of the pump use b-nuts that connect to flexible hoses in the nacelle. The b-nuts can easily be removed when the lines are disconnected for EDP removal. A drain line from the front of the pump casing is connected to a nacelle drain gallery. This drain line dumps fluid overboard through the nacelle, during the discharge of normal shaft seal seepage. The EDP also houses a depressurization solenoid valve used only when necessary to start an engine in flight. This solenoid is controlled by the FADEC (Full-Authority Digital Electronic- Control). When energized, the solenoid valve position shifts, bypassing the compensator, resulting in the pump discharge being reduced to the minimum pressure required to destroke the unit. This reduces the amount of drag-torque on the engine gearbox and results in a pressure reduction to less than 15169 kPa (2200 psi) whenever the aircraft engine %N2 is below 15% and not WOW (Weight-on-Wheels). Since the EDP is driven by the aircraft engine, there is no ON/OFF switch. The flight crew can close the firewall shutoff valve switch on the hydraulic control panel to stop the flow of hydraulic fluid to the pump. The flight crew can also pull the fire handle which also stops the flow of hydraulic fluid to the EDP.


### Alternating Current Motor-Pump (ACMP)
A variable-delivery, pressure-compensated ACMP is a
supplemental source of hydraulic power for each hydraulic
system. Pump operation is identical to that of the EDPs, except
that there are no depressurization solenoids on the ACMPs.
ACMP 1B supplies hydraulic power to the No. 1 hydraulic system.
ACMP 2B supplies hydraulic power to system No. 2 hydraulic
system. The rated output of the ACMP is 14.0 l/min (3.7 gal/min)
at 18616 kPa (2700 psi) minimum. This rating applies with an inlet
pressure of 344.74 kPa (50 psig), when the motor is supplied with
three-phase 115/200 VAC, 400 Hz electrical power.
The ACMP contains a 115/200 VAC, 3-Phase, 400 Hz, explosion-
proof, 6-pole, fan-cooled motor. A varistor is included on each
phase to absorb energy from voltage spikes when the equipment
is turned off.
The ACMPs are installed in the No. 1 and No. 2 hydraulic
compartments mounted on shock mounts attached to the aircraft.
ACMP 1B is supplied with electrical power by 115 VAC BUS 2
from the right engine.
ACMP 2B is supplied with electrical power by 115 VAC BUS 1
from the left engine.
Note that each ACMP is powered by the AC BUS of the engine
opposite that powering the system EDP. In the event of engine
failure, the ACMP related to that system can be powered by the
other engine.
ACMPs 1B and 2B are controlled by ON/OFF/AUTO switches on
the HYDRAULIC control panel.
With 115 VAC, 400 Hz applied at the point of regulation, the in-
rush current transients is 125 amps per phase maximum at
ambient and fluid temperatures of -40 °C (-40 °F). The current
transient decays to one-half of the peak value within one second
of application of motor terminal voltage. The ACMP will start
under any hydraulic load with ambient temperatures from -40 °C
to 74 °C (-40 °F to 165 °F) and inlet fluid temperatures from -40
°C to 107 °C (-40 °F to 225 °F). At ambient and fluid temperatures
from -54 °C to less than -40 °C (-65 °F to less than -40 °F), the
ACMP is allowed a second start attempt.
When set at AUTO, the ACMPs will operate automatically when
high fluid flow is required, such as when the flaps are not stowed,
and the opposite engine generators are powered.
The ACMP 1B will be activated according to the hydraulic system
logic diagram (SSM 29-11-81 ).
The ACMP 2B will be activated according to the hydraulic system
logic diagram (SSM 29-11-82 ).
The ACMP 3B will be activated according to the hydraulic system
logic diagram (SSM 29-12-80 ).
